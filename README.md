Question 1:
-- Sequence Generator --
Write a program that accepts a number n and generates a list of numbers from 1 to n , but replaces multiples of 3 with the word "Fizz", multiples of 5 with the word "Buzz", and multiples of both 3 and 5 with the word "FizzBuzz".
Example: 
Enter a number: 15
[1, 2, 'Fizz', 4, 'Buzz', 'Fizz', 7, 8, 'Fizz', 'Buzz', 11, 'Fizz', 13, 14, 'FizzBuzz']


Question 2:
-- String Reversal Function --
Create a function that accepts a string and returns its reverse. Now, write a program that takes a sentence from the user, splits it into words, and then uses your function to reverse each word in the sentence, but maintains the original order of the words.
Print the original input and the transformed input at the end of the program run.


Question 3:
-- Prime Checker --
Write a program that accepts a number and checks if it's prime or not. Remember, a prime number is a number greater than 1 that is not divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.
